Prompt: Should the death penalty be abolished?,"The death penalty should be abolished.

Furthermore, there is a risk of executing innocent people, which is an irreversible and unethical act. The death penalty also disproportionately affects people of color and those with lower incomes, further highlighting the inequities of the criminal justice system.

For these reasons, the death penalty should be abolished.","The AI's response is well-reasoned and comprehensive.
